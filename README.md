You can visit the deployed version of the app at the link 'https://son421.github.io/clothing-shop/'. 
This app is built with React Redux and written in TypeScript, with the additional UI library react-icons. It’s deployed using GitHub Pages.

When you visit the website, you'll immediately see a list of products. In the top left corner, there's a menu to help you change the currency.
On the top right of the header, there's a cart button—clicking it will take you to the cart, where you can adjust the quantity of your items. 
If a customer reduces the quantity of a product to zero, it will disappear from the cart. To the right of the product section, there’s a form for user details. 
The user cannot submit an order until all fields are completed.
